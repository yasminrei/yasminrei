## Current Project: Web Application for a Wellness & Beauty Brand

### Technical Architecture & Stack

#### Frontend & UI

* **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router) & React 19
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system tokens
* **Geo-Routing:** Advanced Middleware for Geo-IP detection, automatically routing users to the nearest localised node (`/gb`, `/us`, `/jp`)

**Backend & Data**

* **Runtime:** Bun (Monorepo Workspace)
* **Data Fetching:** React Server Components (RSC) integrated with Notion API (Headless CMS)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Dockerised) with Drizzle ORM
* **Type Safety:** End-to-End TypeScript

#### Global Infrastructure (DevOps)

* **Strategy:** Self-Hosted Distributed Network (Multi-Region)
* **Fleet:** Orchestrated across 3 regions: `slc-app-01` (US-West), `tokyo-app-01` (APAC), `fra-hq-01` (EU)
* **Host OS:** Debian / Ubuntu LTS (Hardened Linux environment)
* **Containerisation:** Docker & Docker Compose
* **Networking:** Cloudflare Zero-Trust Tunnels (Mesh Network) & Tailscale for secure inter-node communication
* **Reverse Proxy:** Caddy / Cloudflare Edge (SSL/TLS)
* **CI/CD:** Custom Bash deployment engine + GitHub Actions replacing Vercel

#### Performance & SEO

* **Rendering:** Hybrid strategy utilising Static Site Generation (SSG) for core pages and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for dynamic blog content
* **Data Caching:** Implementation of Next.js Cache components to bypass Notion API latency and reduce Time to First Byte (TTFB)
* **Search:** JSON-LD Structured Data (Schema.org compliant) for Rich Results and search visibility, and optimised Open Graph (OG) metadata for rich social media previews
* **Analytics:** Self-hosted privacy-focused analytics (Rybbit)
* **Assets:** Manual high-fidelity artifact optimisation (WebP) served via Next.js Image component for adaptive sizing and lazy loading.

### Roadmap (TBD)

* [ ] **Booking API:** High-performance API using Elysia + Bun
* [ ] **Observability:** OpenTelemetry + LGTM Stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir)
* [ ] **Disaster Recovery:** Restic automated backups to Cloudflare R2
* [ ] **Internationalisation (i18n):** Full Japanese translation implementation for `/jp` routes
* [ ] **End-to-End Testing:** Implementation of Bun Test and Playwright for critical booking flows.
