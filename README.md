# Hey👋, I'm Yasmin 🌎☄️💕®

I'm a software engineer with a plethora of ideas and an obsession with building

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **a self-hosted Next.js app for a local business**
- 🌱 I’m currently evolving my knowledge on **the frameworks and development tools I already know, and digging into Computer Networking (which utilises knowledge of DevOps & Cybersecurity) by building my own homelab**
- 💬 Favourite topics include **anything to do with tech - languages, frameworks, development tools, projects. I am so fascinated by different perspectives and experiences on different tech projects. I also love fashion (runway and editorial)**
- 📫 Reach out to me at **yasmireidev | at | gmail | dot | com**
- ⚡ My username on social media platforms is usually **@yasminrei or @YasminReiDev.**

## Current Project: Website & App for a wellness & beauty brand

### Done
- Core Engineering
    - Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind, CSS (for custom Tailwind classes)
    - Backend: Typescript, Next.js (Server Actions), Drizzle ORM
- Planning: Github (Projects & Issues)
- Design: Figma, Excalidraw
- Database: PostgreSQL (Dockerised)
- VPS: Linux (Debian, Ubuntu), Oracle Cloud, other smaller VPS providers
- CI/CD: Github Actions, Bash scripts, Docker - replaced Vercel
- Networking: Cloudflare (Zero-Trust Tunnels, DNS, Email forwarding with SPF, DMARC and DKIM), SSL/TLS (Cloudflare & Caddy), Tailscale
- SEO: Next.js SSG & Caching, Sitemap.xml & Robots.txt, OpenGraph, Structured Data (Compatible with Schema.org & Google Schema Markup via JSON-LD), Cloudflare Edge Caching
- Analytics: Rybbit, Google Search Console - replaced Vercel
- Blog: Notion API

### TBD (To be developed):
- internationalisation (i18n)
- booking application system (considered elysia + bun for API, redis for caching - may stick with Next.js server actions due to VPS limits)
- speed insights (considering OpenTelemetry + LGTM stack)
- backup (Restic + Cloudflare R2)
