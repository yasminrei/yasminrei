# Hey👋, I'm Yasmin 🌎☄️💕®

I'm a software engineer with a plethora of ideas and an obsession with building

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **a self-hosted Next.js app for a local business**
- 🌱 I’m currently evolving my knowledge on **the frameworks and development tools I already know, and digging into Computer Networking (which utilises knowledge of DevOps & Cybersecurity) by building my own homelab**
- 💬 Favourite topics include **anything to do with tech - languages, frameworks, development tools, projects. I am so fascinated by different perspectives and experiences on different tech projects. I also love fashion (runway and editorial)**
- 📫 Reach out to me at **yasmireidev | at | g mail | dot | com**
- ⚡ My username on social media platforms is usually **@yasminrei or @YasminReiDev.**
